1-if os.path.exists(TODO_FILE):
Explanation:
os.path.exists(path) is a function from Python's os module that checks whether a file or directory exists at the specified path.
TODO_FILE is a variable that likely contains the file path as a string.
If the file or directory exists, the condition evaluates to True, and the code inside the if block executes.
If the file does not exist, the condition evaluates to False, and the code inside the if block is skipped.

2-open(TODO_FILE, 'R')
open() is a built-in Python function used to open files.
TODO_FILE is the file path (it should be a valid string representing the file name, e.g., "tasks.json").
'r' means read mode, which allows the program to read the file's contents but not modify it.

3-with Statement (Context Manager)
with open(...) as file: is a context manager.
It automatically handles opening and closing the file, even if an error occurs.
When the with block finishes execution, Python automatically closes the file, preventing memory leaks.

4-        return json.load(file)
Reads the content of TODO_FILE and parses it as JSON using json.load(file).
Returns the loaded JSON data, which is expected to be a list of tasks.
